# Getting Started with Street Learning App V2

This is a react app. It allows you to learn in a .json file specified Streets for your needs.
To add new Streets you just need to add a new .json file. After this add your file to the descriptor.xml. Just follow the example. All files can be found under assets.
Now you are ready to go. ;-)

If needed open an issue and i try to help out as far as i can :-)
